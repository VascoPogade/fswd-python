# fswd-python

Full-stack Web Development course at HWR Berlin: material for those Python learning sessions:
+ <https://hwrberlin.github.io/fswd/python.html>
+ <https://hwrberlin.github.io/fswd/python-pt2.html>

The `*.ipynb` files on this repository are interactive Jupyter notebooks.

+ The GitHub web interface renders Jupyter notebooks nicely (view-only).
+ Launch on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hwrberlin/fswd-python/HEAD) to interact with the notebooks directly in the browser.
  + This service often won't work due to resource limitations.

To configure local execution, follow the appropriate [instructions](https://hwrberlin.github.io/fswd/python.html#0-initial-installation-and-configuration-steps).
