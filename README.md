Full-stack web development: material for the Python learning sessions

The `*.ipynb` files are the interactive Jupyter notebooks.

+ The GitHub web interface renders Jupyter notebooks nicely (view-only).
+ Launch on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hwrberlin/fswd-python/HEAD) to interact with the notebooks directly in the browser.
  + This service often won't work due to resource limitations.

To configure local execution, follow this lesson's [instructions](https://hwrberlin.github.io/fswd/06-python.html#0-initial-installation-and-configuration-steps).
